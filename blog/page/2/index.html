  <p><strong>Estonian Open Data community invites you to discuss the future of information society with Dr Rufus Pollock from Open Knowledge and local experts. Could Estonia be the place to try out policy reforms for open information age and what is still needed to be done? What is the part of civil society organisations in aspiring desired changes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Worried about robots taking over all the jobs?</li>
<li>Concerned about growing inequality?</li>
<li>Excited about digital creativity and innovation?</li>
<li>Excited about the possibilities of the Internet?</li>
<li>Want to build an economy and society fit for the information age?</li>
</ul>
<p>Open information is the biggest policy opportunity of the 21st century and of the digital, information age. It offers solutions to all of these questions. However, we are just at the start of this policy revolution. What do we need to do next and how can we make it happen.</p>
<p>More about Dr Rufus Pollock’s current research: <a href="http://www.opendata.ee/en/2016-09-14/avatud-infoyhiskond/">http://www.opendata.ee/en/2016-09-14/avatud-infoyhiskond/</a></p>
<p>We gather from 18:15 at Kohtu 8, Toompea in Tallinn Old Town. The discussion starts with introduction from Rufus Pollock around 18:30. There will be room for questions and time for discussion among participants. Local experts will give their short overviews about status of different fields related to Open Knowledge from 19:15. There will be dinner at the Old Town afterwards (details will follow).</p>

  <p><strong>Why does making an open information age matter? How would it would work? And how do we make it happen? We need to understand why we need to make all public information open, free for anyone to use, share and build on. How a world of open information would work, especially how we can fund innovation and creativity in “open-compatible” ways ranging from up-front methods to remuneration rights.</strong></p>
<p>Dr Rufus Pollock is in Tallinn from September 21st to 23rd:</p>

</ul>
<p>Today, information in the form of software, databases and innovations is becoming more important than ever before not only in our economy but in our societies as a whole. In fact, information is rapidly becoming one of the main things we make, trade and use.</p>
<p>This is a new world being built on “bits” and there’s something very special about it: costless copying. The old world we were used to is a physical one of bread and houses. In that world, having one loaf of bread does not magically mean I have a million. But in the world of information that is exactly what happens: digital information whether it’s a movie or a drug formula can be copied as often as we want, and at practically no cost.</p>
<p><iframe class="img-center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nsVs87QGhQ?rel=0&amp;controls=0" width="560" height="315"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Costless copying offers us a huge opportunity to restructure our economies and societies to make them freer, fairer, and weller. It’s the equivalent of waking up one morning and discovering that we could have unlimited new cars, land and food at the click of a button.</p>
<p>But the possibilities of costless copying will mean little without new rules that embrace those possibilities. Unfortunately, at present we are doing the opposite, taking the property rules that worked so well for land and making intellectual property for information, heedless of the important differences. Monopoly rights such as copyrights and patents deny rather than embrace the possibilities of costless copying. They act to restrict access, limit innovation, and create immense inequalities of wealth and power.</p>
<p>We need a better way and we have one: an open world where all public information can be openly and freely used, shared and built on — by anyone. This is a world where no-one is denied access to life-saving medicines, where everyone has access to research and culture, where artists, innovators and creators are paid more and more fairly. It is a world where rather than relying on private monopolies to fund innovation and creativity we use other, better, mechanisms from up-front funding to remuneration rights.</p>
<p>This is not just about the economy, it’s about society and culture too. An open world is one of sharing, generosity and collaboration. It is a world that is more equal and more fair, where power is better held to account and justice more available.</p>
<p>Though an open future is possible, desirable and necessary getting there is not easy. A combination of mistaken mental models (information is like land) and the gravity of power mean that dystopia is the default: if we do nothing we will get a closed world of exclusion and exploitation. Making a better, open world will take concerted action and sustained engagement from those who share this vision of an open future.</p>
